# dls_pmac_lib

Python library for communicating with Delta Tau PMACs (both Turbo and Power)

This is where you should write a short paragraph that describes what your module does,
how it does it, and why people should use it.

This is where you should put some images or code snippets that illustrate
some relevant examples. If it is a library then you might put some
introductory code here:

```python
from dls_pmac_lib import __version__

print(f"Hello dls_pmac_lib {__version__}")
```

Or if it is a commandline tool then you might put some example commands here:

```
python -m dls_pmac_lib --version
```
